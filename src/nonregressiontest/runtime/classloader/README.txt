This test requires 
1. the ProActive distro installed in userHome/ProActive
2. a generated ProActive.jar file in userHome/ProActive/dist/ProActive/ProActive.jar
(use the "build dist" ant target in the /compile directory)

(otherwise, you need to change the deployment.xml file to match your configuration).
