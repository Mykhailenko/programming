This package and sub-packages provide a customization of the standard 
Fractal ADL for ProActive. It uses standard classes and .fractal files
from the fractal-adl.jar in the /lib directory, and from a use point of view, main differences are : <br>
<ul>
	<li>- a different Launcher class that can work with ProActive deployment descriptors</li>
	<li>- a registry that can store references to instantiated components</li>
	
</ul>
