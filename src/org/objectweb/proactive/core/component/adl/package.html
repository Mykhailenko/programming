This package and sub-packages provide a customization of the standard 
Fractal ADL for ProActive. It uses standard classes and .fractal files
from the fractal-adl.jar in the /lib directory, and from a user point of view, main 
differences between the standard Fractal ADL parser and this one are : 
      <br>
      
<ul>
	<li>- a different Launcher class that can work with ProActive deployment descriptors</li>
	<li>- customized factory and backend
	<li>- a registry that can store references to instantiated components</li>
	<li>- virtual nodes in the ADL can find a mapping in the ProActive deployment descriptor.
	<li>- virtual nodes can be exported and composed ; this allows colocation of processes
	<li>- the dtd is specific to proactive
</ul>
</p>

<p>The architecture of the Fractal ADL has been modified as follows :
</p>
<ul><li>The factory specifies the new compiler and backend to use :</li>

<li>The compiler has a new exportedVirtualNode compiler, and a custom implementation compiler that considers virtual nodes :</li>

<li>The backend has a new exportedVirtualNode builder and a custom implementation builder that handles virtual nodes and stores compoent instances into a registry.</li>
