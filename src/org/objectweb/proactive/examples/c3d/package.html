C3D is both a collaborative application and a distributed
raytracer: users can interact through messaging and voting
facilities in order to choose a scene that is renderer using a set
of distributed rendering engines working in parallel. Near-linear
speedup is achieved with up to half a dozen rendering engines
running in parallel and communicating using ProActive.
</p><p>
There is a benchmark version that is an automation of C3D,
measuring the performance of a 3D raytracer renderer distributed over
several Java virtual machines.
This benchmark gives indication of the performance of ProActive,
the serialization process, and Java RMI itself.
