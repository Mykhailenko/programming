Handlers Small Application Example

Here is an application which show how to add and use
handlers at VM level.

On a distant computer, launch :
java org.objectweb.proactive.examples.handlers.Computer
this is the "application server"

On an other computer, launch
java org.objectweb.proactive.examples.handlers.Student //machine/Computer
where machine is the adresse of the server

Then a window should pop-up.
The first page is a little mathematic application 
provided to test eventual failures occuring within
communication.

The two other pages are more practical as you can generate exceptions
but also add handlers of such exceptions.
